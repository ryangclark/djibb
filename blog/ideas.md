# Ideas for this blog space

Working list of ideas that can be expanded into posts:

- On beauty
    - What the "beautiful" in "building beautiful, remixable checklists" means, and how maybe "beautiful" isn't the right word for what I actually mean...?
- Powered by
    - Flesh out the idea for subtly asking for financial/other support, while also adding quirk/fun to the app
    - Idea is to have a popup/loading/interstitial state that looks something like
        - Headline: "\<app> is Powered By" 
        - Poll itself
            - The the user sees the current poll (new to them), which allows them to vote 
            - Current poll results shown after voting (similar to Twitter)
        - Below the poll, the user sees
            - "Skip" button to allow them to move on without having to interact (can also allow `esc` key press and close `x` icon in upper right)
            - "And by you." with a link to the webpage or whatever that has info about becoming a supporter
                - If the user is a supporter, it could read something like "And by you. Thank you for your continued support." or whatever.
    - Future: Supporters can submit poll options, which, after approval, are added to the poll pool
        - provide credit to the supporter somehow "poll provided by XXX"
    - Selection options:
        - Polls are checkbox (any number of answers is valid), though it's not obvious that it works that way
        - Must choose one option
            - I kinda like how this forces a decision
    - Poll examples:
        - Ramen, Soup
        -
