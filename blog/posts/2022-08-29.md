# Talkin' shop: Selecting a Webapp framework

Let's talk about webapp frameworks: what they are and how I've decided which to use for this project.

## What's a Webapp Framework?

_What's a webapp framework?_

To answer that question, there are a few terms within that question that we'll need to break down.

### What's a Webapp?

A webapp is a type of website developers can use to allow you to view and interact with the website's content. You know and use webapps: Facebook, Pinterest, Figma, Gmail, and many more.

A webapp doesn't contain content. Instead, it has a bunch of code that allows it to go out and the get content you want, and then to display it in your web browser. For example, when you nagivate to facebook.com, the server responsible for that URL responds with a bunch of JavaScript code. That code then makes its own requests to pull in your posts, your friends list, and everything else. That code also then updates the same page dynamically to display new posts, update comments, and show that you liked someone's photo. A webapp is great for this kind of highly personalized, very interactive, and frequently changing content.

The webapp is on one side of the spectrum of how developers can get you your content. On the other side is the webpage, which contains all the content within the server's response. A webpage is great for content that doesn't change much and doesn't have much interactivity. Think of blog posts, recipes, and online shopping pages.

### What's a webapp framework?

A webapp framework is a set of tools developers can use to build a website. Each framework has a different set of strategies and abilities to build websites, whether you want to serve webapps, webpages, or both.

## Picking a webapp framework

I have focused on two main questions while considering which webapp framework to use for this project:

1. Which framework has the best experience for a developer to build?
1. Which framework has the best experience for the user to, well, use?

Luckily for web developers, framework creators have been making huge strides in the tools we can use to build websites, making both points above better all the time. Using any modern framework will very likely be a solid experience, so point #1 doesn't much narrow down the selection pool for me.

That leaves point #2, the user's experience. We're building beautiful, remixable checklists. From there, I can envision two main "modes" of using the checklists:

1. Creating, remixing, and updating your checklists during an extended session
    - For example, a user plans for an upcoming camping trip and, later, uses the checklist as they pack their backpack for the trip
1. Quickly viewing a checklist's status or a pattern's entries
    - A user might share their checklist to publicly show their preparation and/or their progress
    - A user might share their checklist pattern, which others might want to remix into their own checklist

<!-- As with all technology, selecting between a webapp and a static webpage is all about tradeoffs. To complicate things further, modern developer tools -->

<!-- The internet is incredible. At its core, the internet is the idea of computers sending each other files. Much of the internet is the web, which is the part that focuses on the internet created directly for human consumption.

There's a spectrum of how content is delivered to and displayed by your web browser. One side of that spectrum is webpages, which are how the web began. The other side are web-apps, which are the latest era of the web.

Let's begin at the beginning. A webpage is a file that contains all of the content to be displayed. When you navigate to a URL (like www.yahoo.com), the server responsible for that URL can respond with a webpage. Your web browser displays that page and you see it. If two people request that URL, they both receive the same file. It's fast and reliable, and what the first era of the web was all about.

Before long, developers began using a language called JavaScript to add interactivity to their webpages. JavaScript can manipulate almost anything about a webpage, like creating a thumbnail preview of the image the user just uploaded, or powering a stopwatch the user can start, stop, and reset. The content of a webpage is still sent from the server, and that content is now interactive in your web browser using JavaScript.

That brings us to the other end of the spectrum and the most recent era of the web: web-apps. You know web-apps: Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.

Instead of sending a webpage with all of the content like before, developers began to send a webpage that had minimal content and lots of JavaScript. That JavaScript has instructions to go get the data it needs as well as to update the current webpage to display it.

That's why Facebook and Twitter can scroll endlessly. They're built as webapps, so the JavaScript within can recognize that the user is nearing the end of the available content, go retrieve more content from the server, and seamlessly append it to the current webpage.

Web-apps have been an enormous success, and, like any enormous success, they have their critics. All technology is tradeoffs, and webapp critics argue they are often overused and, insodoing, make the web worse for users.

The tradeoff is something like comparing a fast-food joint to a sit-down restaurant. When you're on-the-go and need something quick and easy and consistent, a fast-food place is probably the best choice; if you plan to spend time over your meal as your order multiple times from the server (drinks, appetizers, meals, more drinks, maybe even desserts...?), then a sit-down restaurant is probably your best bet.

That analogy roughly matches the spectrum between webpages and web-apps. If you're delivering something quick and consistent, you should probably be serving webpages; if you're building a tool people will use repeatedly and/or for an extended period, a web-app will likely be a better experience.

That's an overview of a web-app. Now, what's a *web-app framework*?

A web-app framework is a set of tools to create a web-app. Web browsers were built to retrieve and display webpages. In order to do all the fancy stuff webapps do, they need a bunch of JavaScript to know how to get the data they need as well as how to update the page to display it.

To continue the food analogy, it's like a cook versus a chef. A cook can prepare pre-sliced cheese, frozen patties, and a bun from the bakery to get your burger to you quickly and consistently. A chef starts from scratch by sourcing beef from a butcher, pulling a seasonal veggie from the garden, and preparing it the way you asked (medium-rare, please). The chef needs more knowledge to do their thing. -->
